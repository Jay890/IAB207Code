# Anything that we make available in this file we can consume from other places in our application more easily
# without needing to type a full path

# e.g.

# from application.travel.user import User
# x = 10 + 2

# Then we go into the main.py we can import the x variable

# We can shorten path imports


# master_user_instance = User()
# Which we can then import master_user_instance into other files and use that as object
